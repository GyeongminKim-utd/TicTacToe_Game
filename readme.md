# Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Game

**What I have done:**
---
I made two classes, one is TTTGame, and another one is Board.  
TTTGame class has the player information and the whole board's winner information  
and the main function to play the game.  
The Board class has the each small board information to check if the selected square is available  
or the board is full or not. The game continues until there is winner or board becomes full without winner.  

**What I have not done:**
---
The thing I have not done in my code, is storing the each board's winner information.  
The rule is even if there is winner in some board, the next player still can play on that board.  
And for example in my code, if player X won the board#1, and if player O play on board#1 and have staingh 'O' line, the program will read it as there are two winner in Board #1.

**What will I do differently if I restart on this project**
---
I probably work on the scratch before I actually start coding because for this project, I had a lot of moment that I realized that I did not include something that I should have and kept on fixing the code again and again.
